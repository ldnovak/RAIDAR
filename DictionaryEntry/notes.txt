DictionaryEntry:
    DictionaryEntry is the class with an id (ObjectId - springboot defined id), key (String), and valueList (List<String)
        Has operations that are similar to that of modifing lists
    DictionaryEntryApplication is default method that came with importing package
    DictionaryEntryeController is the REST API - NOTE database it is connected to is defiend in application.properties
    DictionaryEntryRepository is the basic MongoDB repository - defines what type of repository and that we can search by id or by key

Tests:
    DictionaryEntry test that are tests for the class of dictionary entry without a repository
    NOTE I was running into issues of Error Application Context not found - I would need to define applicationContext.xml for testing
        Decided to not do that now as takes sometime for me to figure out and will be heavily dependent on connection to database
        Can be changed later for test for REST API are through python
    python:
        simple_interface.py - run it to have a simple interface to run requests to data base
            uses subprocess to run curl through terminal - forgot about requests package and also allows for future easy interface if want other commands through terminal
        api_test.py - test for REST API (basic connection, adding and element, and all aspects of modifying it)
            tests may needed to be broken up into smaller tests in future
            uses requests package
